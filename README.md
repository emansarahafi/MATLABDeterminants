# Determinants in MATLAB
The goal is to determine the viability of various methods of determinant computations that are implementable in MATLAB. The following have been explored:
- Butterfly Method.
- Sarrusâ€™ Method.
- Laplace Cofactor Expansion Method.
- Permutations and Determinants.
- LU Factorization.
- Computing the Determinant of Vandermonde Matrix.
